    // But also we are able to parse as `Expr + Expr`, because the left recursive reference to `Expr` yields `2`
    // and we can continue and parse `2 + 3`. The `Parser` prefers this longer result and so we get

    //
    // Round 2: We store `(2+3, "")` as the previous result and try again. *This time* when we recurse,
    // we get `2` again! The reason why is a bit surprising. The parse of `2` succeeds with remainder
    // `"+ 3"`. But when we go parse `Expr + Expr`, the first `Expr` result yields `2 + 3` and there are no more
    // tokens, so that arm fails. In our loop below, we search back through the result and find that `2` has already
    // occurred, so we take `2 + 3` as the best overall parse.
