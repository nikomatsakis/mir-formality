;; WELL-FORMEDNESS SUBGOALS
;; ------------------------
;;
;; The `well-formed-subgoal-for-ty` gives the rules that make a given
;; type "syntactically well-formed". By syntactically, we mean that it's
;; valid to name the type in that particular way. This distinction can be
;; important with aliases: an alias may be ill-formed (e.g., because the trait
;; where clauses are not satisfied) even if it's normalized form is well-formed
;; (presuming we could normalize it).

  ;; and the parameters meet their where clauses. It's then the *impl's* job to have
  ;; ensured it is WF. The default solver rules, if naively applied, would wind up
  ;; with us trying to unify the alias against every other well-formed type, looking
  ;; for one where normalization succeeds, which is a rathole that leads the solver
